# Object-Oriented-Game-Final

This was a project I worked on in November of 2022 for the Object Oriented Programming course. In this game, you create a character based on one of six classes:
- Knight: The class that was intended to be the all-rounder.
- Berserker: The class that was supposed to be focused on damage in exchange for everything else. Instead, it became the single best class in the game.
- Lancer: The defensive attacker.
- Engineer: A class focused on evasion in exchange for everything else. Easily the weakest class.
- Rogue: A class focused on critical hits and evasion.
- Sniper: A class focused on precision.

From there, you can enter various different multi-wave fights. In these fights, you earn money and experience. Leveling up unlocks the ability to equip certain 
weapons and armour, which you can purchase from the shop.
